# Welcome to the Software Development Engineer in Test Interview Challenge

For this part of the interview, you will write some code to demonstrate your skill set.
Depending on the requirements in the interview, you will create tests against the Star Wars API ([https://swapi.co/](https://swapi.co/)) or create automated tests using Selenium for StarWars.com 


## Install

You will need [Java 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) on your computer and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

Clone this project and either import the files as a new Maven project, or open the project and run the Maven command ("mvn clean install")

## IDE

We use IntelliJ as our IDE. The community edition of IntelliJ is available [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). You are welcome to use IntelliJ or your editor of choice.

## Star Wars API 
To create some automated tests for the Star Wars API, we have included a example in the code found java -> org -> SDET -> interviewtest -> StarWarsApi -> tests -> example -> ApiRootTests.java

We would like you to create some test against the Star Wars API People Endpoint. We are looking for a sample of your code as well as the types of tests you create. Please create no more than 5 new test cases for this endpoint.

### Useful Links
Here are some useful links to help you with your testing:
-   [Starwars API documentation for the People Endpoint](https://swapi.co/documentation#people)
-  [Rest Assured documentation](http://rest-assured.io/)
